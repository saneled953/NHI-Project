# NHI-Project
Dataset & Justification

Dataset: Hospital Management Dataset by Kanak Baghel (Kaggle) Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kanakbaghel/hospital-management-dataset

Why it fits Task One (Healthcare Demand Prediction):

Multi-relational structure: Includes Patients, Appointments, Treatments, and Billing, allowing integration of demographic, clinical, and financial perspectives. This satisfies the project requirement of at least 4 related tables.

Relevant to demand drivers: Contains variables such as age, gender, treatment type, appointment timing, and insurance provider, which are all factors influencing healthcare demand under an NHI-like system.

Realistic hospital context: The dataset simulates actual hospital workflows rather than synthetic toy data. Even though it is relatively small (~200 appointments), it mirrors the complexity of real patient journeys (registration â†’ appointment â†’ treatment â†’ billing).

Transferability to NHI: While not specific to South Africa, the dataset allows us to model demand forecasting methods that would apply once local NHI datasets become available. It is suitable for demonstrating predictive modelling approaches that align with Task One.


## ðŸ“‘ Conclusion

Our project successfully built a multi-relational healthcare demand prediction system using the Hospital Management dataset. By integrating patients, appointments, treatments, and billing data, we created a realistic representation of hospital workflows that can be adapted to the South African NHI context.

Our analysis shows that demand under the NHI can be forecast with good accuracy using non-linear models. This enables proactive staffing, equitable resource allocation, and informed policy decisions â€” ensuring the NHI rollout is both efficient and fair.
